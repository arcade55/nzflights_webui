I would like a new _test.go file that does a get against the flight keystore and write everything in this to a NATS keystore that is in memory, there are examples of this in the code. I would then like a map to be in sync with the store and       │
│   have the same key as the store but to pass the value using package "github.com/arcade55/nzflights-models" var flights []nzflights.FlightValues. I want this test to be essentially a test of what main will do, but without the leaf node mirror       │
│   and for the test to be in main or near the parent dir. I want the test to host the webservers, home to display flights and search to display search
