Or, the extra call out to flightaware can only be done by subscribers as it will be for flights not in the cache, for flights that are weeks out



Show thinking
That's an excellent business model and a great way to manage costs. Architecturally, this is a form of Authorizationâ€”determining what a user is allowed to do.

The best way to implement this is to keep the authorization logic completely separate from your repository. Your repository shouldn't know what a "subscriber" is. Instead, you create different configurations of your service and use middleware to decide which one a user gets to access.

## Role-Based Access via Configuration
The idea is to create two "versions" of your FlightRepository: a basic one that can't perform the expensive API call, and a premium one that can. A middleware layer will then act as a bouncer, directing users to the correct version.

1. Make Your Repository Configurable
First, we'll modify the NewRepository constructor so it can create a "lite" version of the service.



// packages/flights/repository.go

// ... (Repository struct and flightChecker type are the same) ...

// The constructor now accepts a flag to enable the premium feature.
func NewRepository(natsClient *natsmanager.Client, enableAPIFetch bool) *Repository {
	repo := &Repository{
		nats: natsClient,
	}

	// Build the strategy based on the configuration flag.
	checkers := []flightChecker{
		repo.getFromLocalCache,
		repo.getFromCloudCache,
	}

	if enableAPIFetch {
		checkers = append(checkers, repo.fetchAndWatchFromAPI)
	}

	repo.strategy = checkers // Assuming you add a 'strategy' field to the struct
	return repo
}

// GetFlight now uses the pre-configured strategy.
func (r *Repository) GetFlight(ctx context.Context, flightID string) ([]byte, error) {
	for _, check := range r.strategy {
        // ... the exact same loop logic as before ...
	}
    // ...
}


2. Create Both Repository Instances in main()
In your main function, you'll now create two distinct instances: one for regular users and one for subscribers.

// main.go
func main() {
	// ... (natsClient setup) ...

	// Create a repository for non-subscribers (API fetch disabled).
	basicRepo := flights.NewRepository(natsClient, false)

	// Create a repository for subscribers (API fetch enabled).
	premiumRepo := flights.gits.NewRepository(natsClient, true)

	// Create a handler that has access to BOTH repositories.
	masterHandler := handlers.NewMasterFlightHandler(basicRepo, premiumRepo)

	// ... register masterHandler and start server ...
}


3. Create a "Master Handler" to Route Users
This master handler checks the user's subscription status (which would be determined by an authentication middleware) and uses the appropriate repository.

// handlers/flight_handler.go

// MasterFlightHandler acts as a switchboard based on user role.
type MasterFlightHandler struct {
	basicRepo   *flights.Repository
	premiumRepo *flights.Repository
}

func NewMasterFlightHandler(basic, premium *flights.Repository) *MasterFlightHandler {
	return &MasterFlightHandler{
		basicRepo:   basic,
		premiumRepo: premium,
	}
}

// GetFlightInfo is the single endpoint handler.
func (h *MasterFlightHandler) GetFlightInfo(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	flightID := r.PathValue("id")
	var data []byte
	var err error

	// An auth middleware would typically place this info in the request context.
	if isUserSubscriber(r) {
		// Subscribers get the premium repository with the API fallback.
		data, err = h.premiumRepo.GetFlight(r.Context(), flightID)
	} else {
		// Non-subscribers get the basic, cache-only repository.
		data, err = h.basicRepo.GetFlight(r.Context(), flightID)
	}

	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, "Flight data not available", http.StatusNotFound)
		return
	}

	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	w.Write(data)
}


## The Resulting Flow
This approach is incredibly clean. Your core data-retrieval logic in the repository remains pure and unaware of business rules like subscriptions. All the authorization logic is handled at the application's edge, where it belongs.
