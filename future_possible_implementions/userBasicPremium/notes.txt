Or, the extra call out to flightaware can only be done by subscribers as it will be for flights not in the cache, for flights that are weeks out



Show thinking
That's an excellent business model and a great way to manage costs. Architecturally, this is a form of Authorizationâ€”determining what a user is allowed to do.

The best way to implement this is to keep the authorization logic completely separate from your repository. Your repository shouldn't know what a "subscriber" is. Instead, you create different configurations of your service and use middleware to decide which one a user gets to access.

## Role-Based Access via Configuration
The idea is to create two "versions" of your FlightRepository: a basic one that can't perform the expensive API call, and a premium one that can. A middleware layer will then act as a bouncer, directing users to the correct version.

1. Make Your Repository Configurable
First, we'll modify the NewRepository constructor so it can create a "lite" version of the service.



// packages/flights/repository.go

// ... (Repository struct and flightChecker type are the same) ...

// The constructor now accepts a flag to enable the premium feature.
func NewRepository(natsClient *natsmanager.Client, enableAPIFetch bool) *Repository {
	repo := &Repository{
		nats: natsClient,
	}

	// Build the strategy based on the configuration flag.
	checkers := []flightChecker{
		repo.getFromLocalCache,
		repo.getFromCloudCache,
	}

	if enableAPIFetch {
		checkers = append(checkers, repo.fetchAndWatchFromAPI)
	}

	repo.strategy = checkers // Assuming you add a 'strategy' field to the struct
	return repo
}

// GetFlight now uses the pre-configured strategy.
func (r *Repository) GetFlight(ctx context.Context, flightID string) ([]byte, error) {
	for _, check := range r.strategy {
        // ... the exact same loop logic as before ...
	}
    // ...
}


2. Create Both Repository Instances in main()
In your main function, you'll now create two distinct instances: one for regular users and one for subscribers.

// main.go
func main() {
	// ... (natsClient setup) ...

	// Create a repository for non-subscribers (API fetch disabled).
	basicRepo := flights.NewRepository(natsClient, false)

	// Create a repository for subscribers (API fetch enabled).
	premiumRepo := flights.gits.NewRepository(natsClient, true)

	// Create a handler that has access to BOTH repositories.
	masterHandler := handlers.NewMasterFlightHandler(basicRepo, premiumRepo)

	// ... register masterHandler and start server ...
}


3. Create a "Master Handler" to Route Users
This master handler checks the user's subscription status (which would be determined by an authentication middleware) and uses the appropriate repository.

// handlers/flight_handler.go

// MasterFlightHandler acts as a switchboard based on user role.
type MasterFlightHandler struct {
	basicRepo   *flights.Repository
	premiumRepo *flights.Repository
}

func NewMasterFlightHandler(basic, premium *flights.Repository) *MasterFlightHandler {
	return &MasterFlightHandler{
		basicRepo:   basic,
		premiumRepo: premium,
	}
}

// GetFlightInfo is the single endpoint handler.
func (h *MasterFlightHandler) GetFlightInfo(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	flightID := r.PathValue("id")
	var data []byte
	var err error

	// An auth middleware would typically place this info in the request context.
	if isUserSubscriber(r) {
		// Subscribers get the premium repository with the API fallback.
		data, err = h.premiumRepo.GetFlight(r.Context(), flightID)
	} else {
		// Non-subscribers get the basic, cache-only repository.
		data, err = h.basicRepo.GetFlight(r.Context(), flightID)
	}

	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, "Flight data not available", http.StatusNotFound)
		return
	}

	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	w.Write(data)
}


## The Resulting Flow
This approach is incredibly clean. Your core data-retrieval logic in the repository remains pure and unaware of business rules like subscriptions. All the authorization logic is handled at the application's edge, where it belongs.



NATS subjects:

Of course. Based on our entire discussion and the conclusive benchmark results, here is a consolidated summary of the final, recommended key compositions for your flight tracking application.

---

### Key Composition Summary

This design uses a single Key-Value bucket and is built around three distinct, high-performance patterns.

#### 1. The User's Flight List (`users...`)

This is the core data for any given user. It's prefixed by `userID` to create a private namespace and allow for fast, efficient lookups of a user's entire flight list.

* **Owned Flights:** `users.{userID}.flights.owned.{flightID}`
    * **Purpose:** Stores the persistent copy of a flight that a user has added themselves.
    * **Use Case:** The primary key for displaying a flight in the user's main list.

* **Shared Flights:** `users.{userID}.flights.shared.{flightID}`
    * **Purpose:** Stores a separate, persistent copy of a flight that another user has shared with them.
    * **Use Case:** Allows a user to retain flight data independently of the person who shared it.

**Benefit:** Your Go backend can get all flights for a logged-in user with a single, fast `Watch("users.{userID}.flights.>")` operation, providing a real-time view of their personal list.

#### 2. The Sharing Mechanism (`shares...`)

This is a temporary namespace used to handle the process of sharing a flight between users without them needing to know each other's IDs.

* **Pending Share:** `shares.pending.{shareUUID}`
    * **Purpose:** A short-lived, single-use token holding the flight data for an unclaimed share. It's created when User A initiates a share and deleted as soon as User B claims it.
    * **Value:** `{ "flightID": "...", "sharerID": "...", "flightData": {...} }`

* **Sharer's Record:** `users.{sharerID}.shares.sent.{shareUUID}`
    * **Purpose:** A record for the original sharer to track the status of their invitation (pending/claimed) and to have a "sanity check" of what they shared.
    * **Value:** `{ "flightID": "...", "status": "claimed", "sharedDataSnapshot": {...} }`

#### 3. The Scalability Index (`index...`)

This is the most critical component for your backend update service, as proven by our benchmarks. It provides a "reverse lookup" to find all users tracking a specific flight.



* **Flight-to-User Index:** `index.flight.{flightID}.users`
    * **Purpose:** To provide an instantaneous way for your flight data ingestor to find every user that needs to receive a real-time update for a given flight.
    * **Value:** A JSON array of user IDs, e.g., `["user-123", "user-456", "user-abc"]`.

**Benefit:** When new data for a fliAght arrives, your service performs a single, near-instant `Get` on this index key. This avoids the slow, unscalable wildcard scan (`users.*...`) and ensures your system can handle thousands of updates per second, regardless of the total number of users or flights being tracked.

Excellent question. This is a critical detail for creating a truly stable key. I've done the research, and the answer is definitive.

**Yes, the `scheduledOut` time absolutely changes.** Relying on it as an immutable part of your key is not a safe assumption.

### The Research: Why Scheduled Times are Unreliable

My research into airline operations and how data providers like FlightAware handle this reveals two key points:

1.  **Schedules are Fluid by Design:** Airlines publish schedules up to a year in advance, but these are often just placeholders. They are constantly adjusted for a huge number of reasons:
    * **Seasonal Demand:** A route might have three daily flights in summer but only one in winter.
    * **Optimizing Aircraft:** An airline might shift a plane to a more profitable route.
    * **Crew & Airport Logistics:** Changes in crew availability or airport slot times force schedule modifications.
    * **Market Competition:** A competitor adding a new flight can cause other airlines to adjust their times.

    One analysis I found showed that on a random day for a major US airline, **over 92% of their flights had some form of schedule change** from when they were first published. These can be minor (a few minutes) or major (hours or even a change of day).

2.  **How APIs Report Changes:** Data providers like FlightAware distinguish between different types of time. When a flight is delayed on the day of departure, the original `scheduledOut` time often remains the same, but new fields like `estimated_departure_time` or `actual_blockout_time` will show the new information. However, if the airline formally *reschedules* the flight weeks in advance, the base `scheduledOut` time itself is often updated to reflect the new official schedule.

### The Impact on Your Key Composition

If you include the scheduled time in your key (`...{HHMM}...`), and the airline formally reschedules that flight from 08:30 to 09:15, the key for that flight is now wrong. To fix this, you would have to:

1.  Read the flight record from the old key.
2.  Delete the old key.
3.  Create a new key with the new time.
4.  Find and update **every single index and user record** that points to the old key.

This is a complex, error-prone operation that you want to avoid at all costs.

### Final Recommendation: The Most Stable Key

The most robust key is one based on the information that is least likely to change *after the schedule is first published*. As we discussed, the **original scheduled time** is the best candidate for ensuring uniqueness for flights on the same route on the same day.

Here is the final, canonical format we should use:

* **Structure:** `flights.master.{ident}.{YYYY-MM-DD}.{original_HHMM}.{origin}.{destination}`
* **Example:** `flights.master.ANZ5272.2025-09-11.0830.NZAA.NZCH`

**Crucial Implementation Rule:**
The `{original_HHMM}` token in the key must be set **once** when the flight is first ingested and **never change**. All subsequent delays or even formal reschedules must be stored as fields *inside the value* (e.g., in your `Flight` struct), not by altering the key. This gives you a stable, permanent address for each flight instance.
